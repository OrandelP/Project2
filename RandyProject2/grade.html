       <p>Good job on the design and mobile design. The theme is visually appealing and it looks like it was made by a real business.</p>

        <p>Functionally, here are the issues I've found: an image is missing on the home page. The drop down menu's text is unreadable. The chicago text is poorly positioned and blocks the drop down menu. On the sign up page, the grubhub logo is blocking the headline. Your elements are positioned all over the place! Also where are the wireframes? </p>
   
    <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Visual Appeal</td>
                <td>25/25</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Functional</td>
                <td>22/25</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Code Clarity <br><span class="note">Syntax, comments, identation</span></td>
                <td>23/25</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Usefulness<br><span class="note"><span class="note">Marketing, message clarity, engagement</span></td>
                <td>25/25</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>You need to work on element positioning and mobile design. Use flex or percentages % for widths to make elements fit in place. </p>

        <p>Overall, phenomenal job!</p>
